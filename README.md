This is just the script to generate a combined PDF from the currently-online-chapters available for review.

The script also takes care of putting in the right bookmarks for all the chapters in the generated PDF file.

Go read the book from the source at <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html>

## How to generate the book?

Run `./generate.sh`. You will need `pdftk`, and `wget` installed.

Once the script finishes running, check the `security-engineering-3rd-edition.pdf` file.
